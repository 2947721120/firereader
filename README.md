## Use this code in your project

Firereader was built using the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project and [angularFire](https://github.com/firebase/angularFire). It can be used as a template for integrating Firebase with either of these libs.

To use this code in your own project, follow the instructions in the [angular-seed README](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed). The only additional step is to open `app/js/config.js` and set your Firebase URL.
